# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
[Tell us a bit about yourself - your field of study, professional background, interests, or anything else you'd like to share]
Hello! My name is Aranya Shukla and I am a second year student in the Clinical and Epidemiological Research Master's program (TICR). I completed by Bachelor's in Psychology last May from the University of San Francisco and joined this program to gain more experience conducting my own research. 

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]
Through this class, I hope to learn more about different data science tools that I can use while conducting my own research or throughout my career. 

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]
I'm excited learn more about different tools I can use to work with the data. I also really enjoy seeing the results of the code I write - it feels rewarding to see the results of my work! I'm a little worried about not being able to understand the concepts and code since I struggle with handling tools like python, but I'm excited to try.  

## 4. Share something you enjoy!
[Drop a link to something you really enjoy - could be a website, article, video, project, hobby, book, podcast, or anything else you're into]
I recently started learning the guitar and although I haven't had the chance to practice much, I'm excited to start playing some songs I know. A song I'd like to learn to play is "Haunt Me" by Yana: https://youtu.be/hNqmP79BZ8Q?si=tFilJLL6g4U1-z5e
